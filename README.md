# user-management-server
Node app for user management. Using mongodb database.

# Instalations
Must install node before running the project.

# Development
Run `npm install` and then `node app.js`.

# Improvements and Missing implemantaions:
Needs to be secured server(https).
The connection string of the database needs to be configurable and not hardcode.
I guess that the structure of the project can bee more organized.
